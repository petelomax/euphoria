There is a builtin that almost does this for you, and no shame in using that.
(No shame of course in using full longhand/longwinded code to solve this either.)
Tip: the builtin returns {1} rather than the {} this exercise demands, and you'd 
have to override both default parameters to get it to return the right thing.
