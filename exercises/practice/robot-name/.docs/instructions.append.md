# Stress test

Test 8 seeks to prove unique names are generated for all 676,000 robots, but gives up after 5s.
Only if it completes will there be a ninth test (no more robot names). Should you only pass 8 
tests (and the 8th will have "[incomplete]" in it's description), it will still congratulate
you and let you submit your work, but perhaps you should consider a more efficient approach.
The example/test solution manages to fully complete all tests in 0.5s, just so you know.
