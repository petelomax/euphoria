The Phix compiler is normally aware of all the standard packages that are distributed with it, and automatically
incorporates them for you when needed, however that is not always the case, just as it would not be for components 
you have created as part of an application. This (dirt-simple) exercise involves nothing more than locating the 
standard complex number package that is distributed with Phix and making it available for the tests to run. 

You may use the [online][[online] copy of the docs, though if you have installed a copy locally you may find it has 
better search facilities, especially the chm version, typically located in C:\Program Files[ (x86)]\Phix\docs\phix\.

Should you want to learn how complex number arithmetic is implemented, you can do no better than to examine the
source code of that standard component, at least generally speaking - I am not going to deny there may be slightly
better algorithms out there for one or two things, that could be faster or more precise or both.
