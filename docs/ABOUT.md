# About

Phix is a programming language with the following advantages over conventional languages:

## Hybrid interpreter/compiler

All the benefits of a fast development cycle, with the ability to create native executables.

## Clarity

Simple and consistent syntax, and clear straightforward errors can often make debugging almost effortless.

## Dynamic

Fully managed dynamic data storage with no requirement to allocate or free memory. 

## Flexible

Sequences can contain any mix of integer, float, string, or nested sub-sequence elements.

## Safe

Extensive run-time checking for: 
 * out-of-bounds subscripts, 
 * uninitialized variables, 
 * bad parameter values/types being passed to routines, 
 * illegal value assigned to a variable and many more. 

Few if any mysterious machine exceptions -- errors are described as clearly as possible, along with a full stack trace and a most-relevant-first dump of all variable values. 

Programs can be debugged quickly, easily and more thoroughly.

## High level

Features of the underlying hardware are abstracted away. 
Programs are not typically concerned with word-lengths, underlying bit-level representation of values, byte-order, etc.

## Debugger

A source-level tracing debugger and an execution profiler are included.

## Standalone

The distribution contains everything you need to get started, even a full-featured editor, and all installed in a matter of seconds.

## Cross-platform

Phix itself runs under Windows and Linux, but can also generate programs, that with some limitations, esp no file i/o, can be run on any 
platform with a web browser than supports html/js/css.

## Generic

Phix is naturally generic. No special syntax is needed to write a routine that copes with integers, floats, strings etc. 
Phix is not an "object-oriented" language, yet it achieves many of the benefits, and more, in a much simpler way.
It has full support for classes and all that should you need or want them, but you are in no way forced to use them.

## Free

Phix is completely free and open source. It has come a long way since release in 2007, with no sign of improvements slowing down.
