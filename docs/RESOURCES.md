## The Forum

 * The [Euphoria Forum][forum] welcomes questions about Phix.

## Other Resources

### RosettaCode

A curated list of 123 [basic entries][basic]. A search on that site can often turn up just what you're looking for.
Somewhere between a fifth and a quarter of the 1674+ rosettacode entries are bundled in with the standard distro.

### Github

The Phix source [GitHub repository][github].
Obviously updated with every official release, but note it does not generally maintain a "bleeding edge" build.
Most users should stick with the former, it would be worth your time asking on the forum about the latter.

### PCAN

The [Phix Comprehensive Archive Network][pcan], modelled after CPAN, admittedly many entries are somewhat dated.
Effectively a mirror of the [Euphoria archive][archive], from the earliest days till 2018, plus a few newer entries.
